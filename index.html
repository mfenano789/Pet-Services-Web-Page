            <h3>My Beautiful Meoen Cats</h3>
            <p>was adopted at around 6 months old back in 2023. He was considered a shy cat, 
                but has made significant progress over the years to be a much more social cat than expected. 
                The older he gets the more he loves to snuggle up with humans.</p>

                <p>Cats can learn to recognize and respond to their names, but the extent to which they do so can vary greatly from cat to cat. 
                    Some cats readily respond to their names and show recognition by turning their heads, twitching their ears, 
                    or even approaching their owners when called. However, other cats may not respond as consistently or at all.</p>
